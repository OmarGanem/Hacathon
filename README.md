The html file has all the code, in the images folder there is the logo image that is displayed in the page.
how it works: it will ask you to log in, we couldnt implement the wallet into the program, but after you enter any name and password, it will show two options, one scan by QR,
and other one saying find by VIN,
the QR one doesnt work, but the one that says VIN does,
after you enter a random number and cick submit itll show some car data
